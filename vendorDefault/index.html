        <h2>Receive Payment</h2>
        <p>
            We ensure vendors receive their payments securely and on time through our reliable payment system. When a
            service is completed and confirmed by the customer, the payment is processed automatically. A small platform
            commission is deducted to cover operational costs, after which the remaining amount is credited to the
            vendor's account. Vendors can easily track their earnings, request withdrawals, and receive payouts via
            secure payment methods. Our transparent transaction system ensures no hidden charges, providing vendors with
            a smooth and trustworthy payment experience while they focus on delivering high-quality home services.
