              <h2>Content Policy</h2>
              <p>
                    We strive to maintain a positive and constructive environment for
                    our users. Therefore, we have established a content policy to
                    govern the types of content permitted on our platform. This
                    includes user-generated content, reviews, comments, and any other
                    submissions made by users. All content must adhere to our
                    guidelines, which prohibit offensive, defamatory, or inappropriate
                    material. We reserve the right to remove any content that violates
                    these guidelines or is deemed harmful to our community.
                    Additionally, users are responsible for the content they post, and
                    by doing so, they grant Smart Home Service website a
                    non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free,
                    worldwide license to use, distribute, and display the content.
                    This policy ensures a safe and respectful environment for all
                    users, fostering constructive interactions and protecting the
                    integrity of the community. Any content that is flagged or
                    reported for violation of these policies will be reviewed, and
                    appropriate action will be taken based on the severity of the
                    violation.

              <h2>Featured Ads</h2>
              <p>
                    We offer a premium advertisement feature on our platform, allowing
                    businesses to showcase their services to a wider audience. These
                    featured ads are distinct from regular listings and are
                    highlighted on key areas of the website to maximize visibility.
                    Businesses that opt for this feature will benefit from increased
                    exposure, direct leads, and exclusive placements. The criteria for
                    selecting featured ads are based on factors such as the business's
                    reputation, service quality, and customer reviews. Smart Home
                    Service reserves the right to approve or deny any ad based on its
                    content and relevance to the platform. Featured ads are subject to
                    additional charges, and businesses are responsible for maintaining
                    the accuracy of their ad content. This feature is beneficial for
                    businesses looking to expand their reach and attract more
                    customers, providing a competitive edge and enhanced brand
                    visibility. The policies governing featured ads are designed to
                    maintain a high standard of quality and relevance to our user
                    base.

              <h2>User Conduct</h2>
              <p>
                    We expect all users to behave responsibly and respectfully while
                    using our services. Users must not engage in any activity that
                    disrupts the platform or compromises the experience of others.
                    This includes, but is not limited to, posting abusive or harassing
                    content, spamming, or engaging in fraudulent activities. Any
                    violation of these rules may result in the suspension or
                    termination of your account. Users are also prohibited from
                    sharing their accounts with others or using our services for any
                    illegal purposes. By using our services, you agree to abide by
                    these guidelines and understand that any breach could lead to
                    permanent account removal and forfeiture of any purchased services
                    or credits. We take the integrity of our community seriously and
                    reserve the right to investigate and take action against any
                    misconduct. Regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms are in
                    place to ensure the safety and security of all users.

              <h2>Paid Agents and Representatives</h2>
              <p>
                    If you use our services through a paid agent or representative,
                    you are responsible for their actions and compliance with these
                    terms. We hold the account holder, not the representative,
                    accountable for any breaches of the terms. Paid agents must
                    operate within the scope of the services as agreed upon during
                    registration. Any unauthorized actions taken by an agent can
                    result in penalties against the account holder, including service
                    restrictions or account termination. It is the responsibility of
                    the account holder to ensure that any third-party users are aware
                    of and adhere to our terms of service. Smart Home Service is not
                    liable for any disputes that arise between you and your agents.
                    This provision is designed to safeguard the integrity of our
                    platform and protect users from misuse by third parties.

              <h2>No Spam Policy</h2>
              <p>
                    We have a strict no-spam policy in place to protect the quality of
                    our services and the user experience. Spamming includes sending
                    unsolicited messages, bulk messaging, or any form of unauthorized
                    advertising through our platform. Users found engaging in spamming
                    activities may have their accounts suspended or terminated. This
                    policy applies to all forms of communication through the website,
                    including emails, contact forms, and direct messages. Any attempt
                    to circumvent this policy, such as using multiple accounts to
                    spam, will result in immediate action against the user's account.
                    We prioritize user trust and strive to maintain a clean and
                    respectful environment. Violations of this policy undermine the
                    community and can have serious repercussions for the offending
                    user.

              <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>
              <p>
                    Our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
                    [Your Service Company] is not responsible for any indirect,
                    incidental, or consequential damages that may result from the use
                    of our services. We do not warrant that our services will be
                    error-free or uninterrupted. Any liability on our part shall be
                    limited to the amount paid by the user for the specific service in
                    question. This limitation applies to all aspects of the services,
                    including but not limited to, any technical issues, service
                    interruptions, or loss of data. Users agree to indemnify and hold
                    Smart Home Service harmless from any claims arising from their use
                    of our services. This provision helps manage risk and provides a
                    clear understanding of the limits of our responsibilities.

              <h2>Violation Of Terms And Liquidation Damages</h2>
              <p>
                    Failure to comply with these terms may result in the suspension or
                    termination of your account, loss of any paid services, or other
                    penalties. In the event of a breach, Smart Home Service reserves
                    the right to pursue appropriate legal action to remedy the
                    situation. Liquidation damages may apply, depending on the
                    severity of the violation. These penalties are intended to
                    discourage misuse of our services and to protect the integrity of
                    our platform. The decision to impose such penalties is at our sole
                    discretion, and any incurred damages are non-negotiable. Users
                    agree to these terms upon acceptance of the "Terms of Use." This
                    policy ensures a fair and consistent approach to breaches,
                    maintaining the overall security and quality of our platform.

              <h2>Ability To Accept Terms Of Service</h2>
              <p>
                    By using our services, you affirm that you have the legal capacity
                    to enter into this agreement. Minors are not permitted to use our
                    services unless they have parental consent. If you do not meet the
                    legal requirements, you must refrain from accessing or using our
                    services. If you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal
                    entity, you affirm that you have the authority to bind that entity
                    to these terms. Smart Home Service reserves the right to verify
                    user age or capacity and take action if these conditions are not
                    met. This provision ensures that all users are legally capable of
                    engaging with our services, thereby safeguarding their rights and
                    our platform's integrity.

              <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
              <p>
                    At Smart Home Service, we understand that plans can change, and
                    sometimes it may be necessary to cancel a scheduled service. To
                    maintain fairness and ensure a smooth experience for all users, we
                    have established a clear cancellation policy that applies to all
                    service bookings made through our platform. Users are permitted to
                    cancel their service bookings up to 24 hours before the scheduled
                    appointment time without incurring any fees. This provides a
                    reasonable window for users to modify their plans without penalty.
                    Cancellations made within this 24-hour window will not be
                    refunded, and the full service fee will be forfeited. We encourage
                    users to review their schedules and confirm appointments well in
                    advance to avoid any inconvenience. In exceptional cases where the
                    cancellation is due to an unforeseen circumstance such as severe
                    weather conditions, medical emergencies, or other unavoidable
                    events, Smart Home Service may consider waiving the cancellation
                    fee. Users must contact our customer support team to explain the
                    situation and request an exception. These requests are handled on
                    a case-by-case basis and are subject to approval. Users are
                    encouraged to keep our support team informed as early as possible
                    to facilitate this process. For recurring services or longer-term
                    contracts, users must provide a minimum of seven days' notice to
                    cancel without penalty. Any cancellation within this period may
                    result in partial charges based on the services provided up to the
                    cancellation date. This policy ensures that Smart Home Service can
                    fairly account for the services rendered before cancellation,
                    while still offering flexibility to users who may need to make
                    adjustments to their service agreements. It is the responsibility
                    of the user to manage their bookings effectively and to contact
                    our support team to cancel any appointments. Failure to do so may
                    result in additional charges, and no-show fees may apply if the
                    user fails to notify us within the cancellation period. We provide
                    users with multiple channels for cancellation, including online
                    through their accounts, via email, or by contacting our customer
                    support team directly. We recommend confirming the cancellation in
                    writing to avoid any misunderstandings regarding the cancellation
                    terms.

              <h2>Refunds and Payments</h2>
              <p>
                    Smart Home Service aims to ensure a transparent and
                    straightforward payment process for all our services. Our refund
                    policy is designed to protect the interests of our users while
                    maintaining the sustainability of our service offerings. Users may
                    request a refund if they are not satisfied with the service
                    provided or if there are issues related to the quality of service.
                    All refund requests must be submitted within a reasonable
                    timeframe after the completion of the service. The refund request
                    should include relevant details, such as the booking reference
                    number, the reason for the refund, and any supporting evidence
                    such as photographs or communication with our service provider.
                    Refunds are generally processed within 7 to 10 business days from
                    the date the refund request is approved. The refund will be issued
                    to the same payment method used for the original transaction. For
                    cash payments, refunds may take slightly longer due to processing
                    time at our end. Users are encouraged to contact our customer
                    support team as soon as possible to discuss any concerns related
                    to refunds. If a refund is granted, the full amount paid for the
                    service will be refunded, minus any applicable cancellation fees
                    if applicable. For payment issues that arise before the service is
                    rendered, such as a discrepancy in the billed amount, users should
                    immediately notify our customer support team to resolve the issue.
                    Any overpayments will be refunded in full, and users will be
                    notified of any adjustments made to their accounts. In cases where
                    payments have already been processed but the service has not yet
                    started, a full refund will be provided upon cancellation within
                    the allowed window. We reserve the right to refuse refunds in
                    cases where the service has already been completed, and the user
                    has not raised any concerns during or immediately after the
                    service. Refunds may also be denied if the user has violated our
                    terms of service, such as engaging in fraudulent activities or
                    providing false information. Smart Home Service also reserves the
                    right to refuse refunds for certain premium services that are
                    non-refundable once booked, such as special offers or packages.
                    Payments are typically made through secure online platforms using
                    credit/debit cards or other digital payment methods. We ensure
                    that all transactions are secure and encrypted to protect user
                    data. Users can manage their payment methods, track transactions,
                    and view payment histories through their account dashboard. We
                    provide multiple payment options to accommodate the convenience of
                    our users, and all payments must be made in full before the
                    service is rendered unless other arrangements have been made in
                    advance with our customer support team.

              <h2>Assignment of Rights</h2>
              <p>
                    Smart Home Service reserves the right to assign these terms, and
                    any of our rights or obligations under them, to third parties.
                    This includes transferring user accounts, service obligations, or
                    any of our assets. Users may not transfer their rights or
                    obligations under these terms to any third party without our
                    explicit consent. This provision ensures that we can continue to
                    provide high-quality services and uphold the integrity of our
                    platform if we decide to partner with other companies or change
                    our business model. By using our services, you agree to allow us
                    to transfer your account to a new service provider in the event of
                    a merger, acquisition, or restructuring. This transfer does not
                    affect your rights or obligations under these terms; it simply
                    ensures the continuity of service. We will notify users of such
                    changes in advance and provide an opportunity to review the new
                    terms and conditions before the transfer.

              <h2>User Submissions and Content Ownership</h2>
              <p>
                    When users post, upload, or submit content to [Your Service
                    Company], they grant us a non-exclusive, transferable,
                    sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that
                    content. This license is necessary for us to operate our services,
                    promote user-generated content, and share it across different
                    sections of the website. Users retain ownership of their content,
                    but by submitting it, they allow Smart Home Service to display,
                    distribute, and promote it. This policy ensures that we can
                    maintain the quality and integrity of user-generated content
                    across our platform. Users are responsible for ensuring that the
                    content they submit does not infringe upon the rights of any third
                    parties and complies with our content policy. If a user wishes to
                    remove their content from our platform, they may do so at any
                    time, although copies may remain on backup servers for an
                    additional period as part of our data retention policies.

              <p>
                    We may update these terms from time to time. The updated terms
                    will be posted on our website with a revised "Last Updated" date.
                    Users will be notified of any changes through a prominent notice
                    on the website. Continued use of our services after any
                    modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. It is
                    the responsibility of the users to review the terms periodically
                    to stay informed about any changes. If users do not agree with the
                    revised terms, they should cease using our services. These
                    amendments ensure that Smart Home Service can adapt to changing
                    legal, regulatory, and business requirements.
