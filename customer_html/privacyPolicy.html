            <h2>Tips for safe transaction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always use trusted and verified payment gateways provided on our website. Avoid direct payments to vendors without confirmation, ensuring safe and secure transactions with proper tracking and receipts
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prefer online transactions over cash payments for better transparency and proof of payment. Digital records ensure accountability and can help resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that may arise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before proceeding with any payment, ensure the vendor's identity and details match the verified profiles listed on our platform to prevent scams or unauthorized activities during service requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss and confirm service costs before making payments. Request an invoice or written agreement to avoid hidden charges or unexpected fees, ensuring clarity between you and the vendor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Always enable payment notifications via email or SMS for online transactions. These alerts help track payment status and serve as quick references for resolving disputes or errors in transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid sharing sensitive payment details like card numbers, CVVs, or passwords with vendors or any unauthorized personnel. Transactions should occur through secure and trusted platforms to protect data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Secure your account with strong, unique passwords that include letters, numbers, and special characters. Regularly update your credentials to safeguard your financial and personal information on the platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After every payment, verify the receipt and transaction status. Save all payment records, as they provide essential proof of the completed transaction for refunds, cancellations, or disputes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not click on suspicious links, emails, or pop-ups claiming payment issues. Access our secure website or contact support directly for any transaction-related updates or clarifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perform online transactions only over a secure internet connection. Avoid public Wi-Fi, as it may compromise payment details. Use trusted devices and networks for a safe experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For added security, enable two-factor authentication when accessing your account or making payments. It provides an extra layer of protection to secure your transactions and prevent unauthorized access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before transferring money, cross-check the payment request details, vendor name, and bank information. Fraudulent vendors might attempt to impersonate verified professionals and exploit trusting customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regularly check your transaction history for unusual activities or unauthorized payments. Early detection allows you to report concerns quickly and protect your financial information from potential fraud.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you suspect fraudulent activity during a transaction, immediately contact our support team. We will investigate and ensure necessary actions are taken to secure your account and payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For expensive services, opt for escrow payments to hold funds securely until the service is completed. This protects both parties by ensuring funds are released only after job satisfaction.
